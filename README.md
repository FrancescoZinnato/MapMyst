MapMyst is a project we're looking to further expand, that started as a Monster Builder helper for D&D edition 4.
We used SpringBoot - Hibernate - JavaScript - Freemarker Template - Css - MySQL.
Database Dump has the Create Schema included.
Make sure to check the application.properties file and use your database username and password.
